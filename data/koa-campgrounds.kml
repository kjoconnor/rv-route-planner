<b>Alert Message:</b> We at the Seward KOA are looking forward to the 2020 RV Camping Season.    We understand there is a lot of uncertainty in the world today but one thing we know for sure, there will be a summer camping season in Alaska.  Our campground is ideal for providing your families plenty of space and fresh air to enjoy the Alaska outdoors.  Our sites are 65 ft long and 40 ft wide. This provides for adequate social distancing from you and other campers.  Our bathhouse with private family style bathrooms and laundry facility are brand new and we ensure the facilities are cleaned several times a day.    This year we have several new features to our campground.   We are starting a new punch card for our frequent guests.  For every 9 camping nights you get a night free. In addition, we have added the ability for you to check-in curbside if you choose without ever leaving your vehicle/camper/RV.  We will have our coffee cart and concierge desk up and running plus other fun activities taking place on site. Seward KOA desires to be your campground of choice while in Seward.   With a busy summer ahead, it is never too early to make your reservations now for the summer season.  Our seven-day cancellation policy allows you the peace of mind to cancel if your travel plans change.<br>

<b>Alert Message:</b> Effective May 17, 2020:  NEW LODGING ORDER FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY (Order will be updated every two weeks…so please check back often.)  Santa Margarita KOA must reduce its capacity by 50% and limit camping to Residents of San Luis Obispo County.  In particular, folks from Kings, Tulare, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Fresno, Kern and Ventura Counties are asked to postpone visiting the Central Coast for a few more weeks. FYI If you are not from San Luis Obispo County, you will not be able to use the nearby Santa Margarita Lake.  Be prepared to show your ID to verify your San Luis Obispo County address.  Our Log Cabins, Tent Sites and Community Restrooms will remain closed until further notice and new reservations will only be accepted from San Luis Obispo County Residents and Essential Workers for full hook-up RV sites and Deluxe Cabins with a private restroom with a two-night minimum (No linens, pillows or towels will be provided).   Oh yeah, and all of our on-site group activities have been canceled until further notice.  The Lodging Order asks that we not accept reservations for leisure, recreation or vacations even though the CDC now says that being outside in the fresh air is healthier than Sheltering-At-Home with Cabin Fever.  Please assess your situation, address and risk, then give us a call to book a site, reschedule, cancel or discuss an existing reservation.  If you book online without adhering to the San Luis Obispo County LODGING ORDER, we reserve the right to cancel your reservation.  Thank you for your patience and understanding during the COVID-Craziness.  We are still Happy Campers at Santa Margarita KOA (805)438-5618.<br>

We do have some grocery items in the store if you need them like milk, water, eggs, soup, toilet paper, medicine, & RV supplies, etc. We are allowed to open it, but feel it is still safer to keep it closed, so we are happy to deliver to your site for you if you would like. We also have a small menu that we can make some food items and deliver them to your site between 9am and 6:30 pm M-Sat, 1:30pm and 6:30 pm on Sundays.

<b>Alert Message:</b> COVID-19 UpdateMay 14, 2020- Just like most of you, we too have many questions regarding our business and how and when we will be able to open and operate. Here is what we do know:1.) All reservations through May 21, 2020 are hereby cancelled and we are actively reaching out to those affected guests. 2.) As of May 21, 2020 moving forward, we will cancel or postpone reservations if required by the government one (1) week prior to the planned arrival date (i.e. Notify guest on May 21 for a May 28 arrival date).3.) If you wish to make a new reservation, we are only authorized to make new reservations for arrival dates on June 15, 2020 or later. For existing reservations with arrival dates prior to June 15 , 2020, see the two points above.***Note- The "Stay Home/Stay Safe" Executive Order and all Addenda thereto and Directives issued thereunder expire at midnight on May 15, 2020.

What to expect upon arrival and during your stay:1.) The Quechee Pine Valley KOA will continue to comply with all federal, state, and local orders, directives, and guidelines regarding COVID-19.2.)

The information listed above is all we know currently and hope to update you with more specifics in the near future.

<b>Alert Message:</b> Hello from the Cardinal KOA:.  We are still closed for camping.On May 14th the Ontario Government released the following campground restrictions:  "parks and campgrounds may open to enable preparation for the season and to allow for trailer and recreational vehicles whose owners have a full season contract".Unfortunately that means that regular overnight camping is not permitted yet.  This is a very good sign that it won't be long before we are able to open. We are anxiously awaiting Good News and thank you for your patience,Karen & Daniel<br>
